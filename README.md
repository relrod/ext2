# ext2

### Background

I'll be taking an operating systems course as part of my Computer Science
degree. One assignment that the professor of this course often assigns deals
with knowing the internals of ext2 and writing a set of programs that
manipulates an ext2 filesystem in some low-level way.

This is my way of learning about ext2 and (possibly) making my life easier
later by using this library in the assignment code, if I can convince the
professor to let me use Haskell.
